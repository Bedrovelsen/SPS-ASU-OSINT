## LTE Hotspot

They apparently have a LTE hotspot on board which I want to caputre some passie AP reqest broadcast frames from in flight from the ground to confirm this which requires a parabolic antenna but until then since we know where they start and land and likely store the plane we can look at wigle.net networks around the areas they are not in the air as they taxi to and from the runway according to ASDBExcaange flight dat. There are two ways to approach this, eiter querying wigle.net for the small region that they taxi to and from along daily or maybe they set the LTE Hotspot SSID so it has he letters ASU in it? to the name ASU hotspot ASU If we limit the scope of a wigle search to this area here is a small blip of Wigle.net network data that is in the area they operate the plane out of.

Turns out both emthods worked.
